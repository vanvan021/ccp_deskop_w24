                <p class = "item3">This pizza pie is a mosaic of flavors so robust that each slice is a culinary expedition in itself. A word of advice: approach with a hearty fork and an empty stomach. Indeed, this pizza is a marathon, not a sprint, and is best enjoyed fresh from the oven, with strings of mozzarella stretching with every lift.</p><br>
                <p class = "item4">Note, this pizza is a labor of love, so be prepared to spend some time in the kitchen. The result is well worth the effort.</p>
